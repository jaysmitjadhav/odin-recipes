        <p>This recipe makes the most tender and tasty meatballs. I also freeze these meatballs and take out how many servings I need for each meal. If cooking in sauce, add baked meatballs 20 minutes before serving time.</p>
        
        <ul>Ingredients
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>Â¾ cup chopped onion</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>Directions
            <li>Cook the lasagna noodles in a large pot of boiling water for 10 minutes, or until al dente. Rinse with cold water, and drain.</li>
            <li>In a large saucepan, cook and stir mushrooms, green peppers, onion, and garlic in oil. Stir in pasta sauce and basil; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix together ricotta, 2 cups mozzarella cheese, and eggs.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread 1 cup tomato sauce into the bottom of a greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Layer 1/2 each, lasagna noodles, ricotta mix, sauce, and Parmesan cheese. Repeat layering, and top with remaining 2 cups mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake, uncovered, for 40 minutes. Let stand 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
